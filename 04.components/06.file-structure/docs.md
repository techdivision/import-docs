Generally, M2IF supports any given file format to be imported. The main format, and actually the only provided one, is the CSV format, which in case for the product import, is 100 % compatible. The file format for the available import entities product, category and attribute is described in the following chapters.

Additional formats can be implemented by either adding new adapters, e. g. for XML or a plug-in to transform XML to CSV
